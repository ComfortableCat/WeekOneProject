# WeekOneProject

I achieved all standard requirements and almost all stretch requirements.
I struggled with adding audio as i struggled to check if it linked properly and struggled to figure out how to make it play on the loading of the page. If i click the logo which links me to the page it does play as expected but otherwise it doesnt. I struggled with the javascript for this not knowing the code to console log the events and times i wanted. I feel I could've added other wanted features like the drop menu if I hadn't focused on this stretch.

I found stackoverflow and mdn web_docks helpful for understanding selectors and finding attributes.
I know I should add alt text for images and I dont know why the images do not load from the git to the website for the logo and social media icons. They display properly on my locahost.

At one point I had an error where I had set the width of .containercontent to 100% before positioning which caused side scrolling. I asked for help from students and tutors and managed to fins the bug and solved it while keeping the beneficial formatting I had before.

Idk what specific feedback to askfor I struggle knowing what to ask for help on and would like to have thorough feedback where possible.
maybe if theres ways to do things more effficiently let me know.(i know some lines of my code are redundent/dont apply to selectors)
